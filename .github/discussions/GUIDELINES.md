# trax Discussions — Posting Guidelines & Templates

Please follow these guidelines so Discussions stay useful and welcoming.

Be respectful
- Treat others with respect. No harassment, discriminatory language, or personal attacks.
- Keep language professional and constructive.

Search first
- Check existing Discussions and Issues before posting to avoid duplicates.

Write useful posts

Moderation and enforcement
- Maintainers and selected moderators can pin/move/close Discussions.
- Off-topic/duplicate/rude posts may be locked or removed.
- To report abuse or private concerns, open a confidential Issue addressed to maintainers, or mention a maintainer in the repo’s issue tracker.

Thread housekeeping
- Moderators may convert Discussion threads into Issues for actionable work.
- Mark threads resolved if there is a clear resolution (or add a summary reply).
- Keep long-running design threads focused; consider summarizing decisions periodically.

Private data & security
- Do not post secrets, API keys, or personal data.
- If you discover a security vulnerability, report it via the repository's security policy or open a private security issue.

Language & accessibility
- English is the default language for public threads; keep sentences short and clear to help non-native speakers.
- Use code blocks for code and paste logs as text rather than screenshots when possible.

Minimal moderation roles to assign (recommended)
- 1–2 maintainers as moderators to review new posts
- A triage rotation for handling support requests and moving duplicates into canonical threads

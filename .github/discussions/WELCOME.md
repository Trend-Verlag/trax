# Welcome to the trax Discussions

Welcome — thanks for joining the trax community! This Discussions area is for community conversation that doesn't require an immediate code change. Use it to ask for help, propose ideas, announce news, or talk about development and integrations.

Purpose
- Community help and support
- Feature requests and design discussion
- Announcements, release notes, and roadmap conversations
- Technical discussion around plugins, integrations, or architecture

Where to post
- Announcements — project news and release announcements (maintainers only)
- General — general conversation about the project, use-cases, and community
- Help & Support — for troubleshooting and usage questions (see support template)
- Feature Requests — propose and discuss new features or API changes
- Development / Internals — for contributors working on implementation details
- Off-topic — non-project social conversation (optional)

Issue vs Discussion
- Open an Issue when you have a reproducible bug, a security problem, or are submitting a PR-ready change.
- Use Discussions for support, brainstorming features, or higher-level design conversations that benefit from back-and-forth.

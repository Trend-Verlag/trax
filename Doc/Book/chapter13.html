        <b>A Sensor along a track register the event of something passing by in its 
        direction.</b> As it turned out, there are many uses of such sensing devices. 
        For example they might trigger on each axle passing by, counting up a counter 
        each time. Other Sensors can be arranged to trigger for every axle that is 
        leaving a certain area, counting the counter down. This can be used to lower 
        a barrier as soon as the counter is greater than zero - and lift it up as soon 
        as it becomes zero again. This way a road can get protected, even if it crosses 
        multiple track lines.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other uses might include sensing a train tip or a train end, passing the Sensor's 
        location. The Sensor can get configured to only trigger under certain circumstances. 
        E.g. if the velocity is inside a certain velocity range. It might be tempting to 
        have the trackjoint (see Chapter 7) triggering Sensors on its journey along the 
        tracks, but that is hardly ever useful. Better it is to start with a more general 
        notion of a Location, relaying an Event to trigger the Sensor:

    <p>
        While a Location is moved along the tracks, thereby for example representing a 
        train tip, it is fed by an Event, carrying the necesssary information for a 
        specialized Sensor to figure out whether to trigger. If the Sensor triggers that
        would mean it creates a pulse in an associated Jack (see Chapter 10).
    </p>

        These sensors, called 'Kontaktpunkte' have been a huge success with EEP. Connecting
        them with switches and signals allows for traffic control of all kind, using the 
        rolling trains themselves as a sort of CPU. This kind of 'computing' is parallel 
        by design. Even separate 'Steuerstrecken' with small vehicles running around them 
        in enormous speeds, triggering all the 'Kontaktpunkte' have been invented. The 
        pinnacle of this evolution is miniaturisation of the 'Steuerstrecken' and hiding 
        them under the terrain.

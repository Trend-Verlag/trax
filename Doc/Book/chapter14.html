        <b>A Signal is a directed range along the tracks that provides information </b>to 
        be send to a SignalTarget, while moving a Location along the track inside that range 
        and according to the ranges direction. Clearly this can be used in the way modern 
        Linienzugbeeinflussung[<a href="#[1]">1</a>] works, where along a track range time 
        varying information is sent to a train. But also old style signalisation applies, 
        if one takes into account that there always is a range from a pre signal to a main 
        signal in which the conductor of the train is expected to read the meaning of the 
        signal and act accordingly - say to stop in front of the main signal after passing 
        the pre signal. Once the train passed the main signal, its state does no longer 
        apply to the train:

    <p>
        Punktf&ouml;rmige Zugbeeinflussung[<a href="#[2]">2</a>] is only slightly more tricky,
        since it requires a non zero range, long enough to have the Location not jump over 
        it in one simulation step, given the maximum expected speed:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        Range.Length() >= MaxSpeed * MaxSimulationStep;
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        Note that Signal ranges can not include switches (see Chapter 4) that branch in 
        their direction. So it is best avoided to strech the range of a Signal over any 
        switch at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also there is an important issue with Locations that 'happen to inadvertently 
        roll backwards'. This might seem like an occurence, best ruled out by definition, 
        but with trackjoints in a physical simulation environment, it happens to happen 
        quite often. To guarantee the Location relaying the information from the correct 
        Signals, there has to be supplied a principal direction of the movement which might 
        differ from the direction of the actual movement.

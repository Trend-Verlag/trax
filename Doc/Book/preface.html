    <blockquote style="text-align: right; font-size: 0.9em;"><i>"Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler."</i><br /> - Albert Einstein</blockquote>

    <p>
        I hate to quote Einstein, but here I have no option. This is the simplest version - or at least very close to it - of tracks and trains in a software
        based simulation. Any try to further simplify it will lead to shortcommings and failures if it comes to train like things running along track like things.
        It's possible, but you'll loose generallity and you will hack around forever to make your system go.
    </p>
    <p>If you have a basic knowledge in C++ or a similar programming language, and be ready to start with Unreal Engine, then this book is for you.</p>
    <p>
        To fully understand this book you need to have some acquaintance with calculating numbers; with trigonometry, matrix calculation and differential calculus.
        The good news is, that there are plenty of articles in the english Wikipedia and explanationatory films on Youtube. Make use of them. We - you and me - won't slow down.</p>
    <p>
        I spared myself from bothering you with exercises. With the exception where the results are needed lateron in the book and I didn't had time to actually write them down and it so should
        be the case that you do not believe in my results. For two reasons: first, exercises tend to be simple for the expert but difficult for the novice. After all humankind has produced these
        results only after thinking about them for more than some 3000 years. And it is not rewarding, because the 'correct' answere is already in my drawer. But before
        all, secondly, I believe that you as a programmer have your own problems to fix, and be well better off to work on them - maybe with the guidance of this book.

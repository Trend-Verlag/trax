# trax ROADMAP

This document explains planned work, priorities and how we map roadmap items to issues and releases.

Principles
- Keep roadmap high-level and focused on user-facing outcomes.
- Convert any roadmap item into an Issue that carries the implementation discussion and PRs.
- Use Milestones for releases and a Project board for active work.

# trax ROADMAP

This document explains planned work, priorities and how we map roadmap items to issues and releases.

Principles
- Keep roadmap high-level and focused on user-facing outcomes.
- Convert any roadmap item into an Issue that carries the implementation discussion and PRs.
- Use Milestones for releases and a Project board for active work.

## Now / Next (next milestone)
- Improved curved-track interpolation — better handling of tight radii. (status: planned) — issue: #<link> — owner: @alice — target: v0.2.0

## Short term (next release)
- Add logging and debug visualization for track layout parsing. (status: planned) — owner: @bob — milestone: v0.2.0

## Long term
- Multi-train distributed simulation with synchronized physics stepping. (status: idea) — no owner

## Wishlist
- Import/export of real-world track formats (GPX/OSM).
- Support for custom vehicle controllers as plugins.
